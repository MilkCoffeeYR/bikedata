\description{
Store hire bicycle data in spatialite database
}
\note{
Data for different cities are all stored in the same database, with
city identifiers automatically established from the names of downloaded data
files. This function can take quite a long time to execute (typically > 10
minutes), and generates a spatialite database file several gigabytes in size.
